# How to do

All simulation studies are to be run from their respective folders, i.e., study A is to run from SimA_IM as its working dir.

All figures used in paper will be deposited in figures folder.

Before you start on a simulation study, make sure you have installed the packages used within it.

Also some studies uses the auxilary package 'tsars'. You need to install it from source (see parent folder).

## Sim A:
run test_IM.R

## Sim B:
run main.R
thereafter run R/read_results.R

## Sim D
run main.R

## Sim E
run main.R
thereafter run read_results.R

## Sim F
run main.R
