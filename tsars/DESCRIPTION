Description: 
        This package implements the exhaustive gradient matching method 
		for mass action kinetics type of ODE systems. This algorithm is very much
		inspired by the paper Topological Sensitivity Analysis for Systems Biology by
		Babtie et al., PNAS, (2014), and is used in the paper 
		Statistical Learning of Ordinary Differential Equation Systems by 
		Mikkelsen and Hansen, 2019. Installing this package will also install 
		all packages needed to run the code from that paper, including the 
		main package, episode, developed for the paper, which implements the 
		general learning algorithms.
