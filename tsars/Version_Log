Version 0.0.2.0001
------------------
  * Created exact best subset selection (bss)

Version 0.0.2.0000
------------------
  * Reworked tsars such that it now searches among reactions and not parents.
    - gpfit not changed
    - mak not changed
    - parents is deprecated
    - tsars main function rewritten





Version 0.0.1.0001
------------------
  * Made tsars-function that applies fit_models.
  * magrittr now in Imports.


Version 0.0.1.0000
------------------
  * Initialised package of tsa for mak. Thought it would be easier to keep stuff in a package.
  * First function for export: gpfit, which fits a GP to data.
  * Wrote formal test for gpfit.
  * join's, find_reactions and mak_enzyme made for mak objects. Also tests.
  * parents function, which systematically writes up parents set.
  * Created X_full making the design matrix for gm.
  * Created fit_models for "fast" fitting multiple submodels in linear model. First implementation in Rcpp still exists, but was scrabbed, as it does not search for non-negative solutions. Second implementation relying on 'nnls' now in use.
  * fit_models now include pos_coef option to switch between 'nnls' and 'lm.fit'.
